This application can create text data that are structured as `node`. These `nodes` contains a content and child-`node`.

For the moment there's only technological tests. These `TTs` are in the `TTs` folder. There are 4 tests (3 small tests and a _super test_)

# Run TTs

``` shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alikadev/A30_project.git
```

> Open the TT that you want to run with Xcode and run it with the simulator or your device.
